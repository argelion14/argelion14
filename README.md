👋 Hi, I'm Ángel — software engineer.

🔧 I enjoy automating: I design and implement workflows and CI/CD pipelines to make development and deployment repeatable and reliable.

⚙️ Interests: DevOps and security (secure CI/CD practices, hardening, and monitoring).

☁️ Cloud: learning Azure and AWS to integrate cloud infrastructure with my pipelines.

🐳 Home lab: I run several Docker images on a home server, and I'm diving into Kubernetes to better orchestrate and scale my services.
